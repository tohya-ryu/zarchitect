The software this website runs on. I used a static site generator ([jekyll][1]) for a while, but wasn't super happy with the somewhat tedious update process. At some point I started thinking about rewriting another app in [rails][2], and figured writing a new engine for this blog would be a more fitting project to learn about the framework.  
I learned how to use and work with rails as I went on and decided on the features in the same fashion, so it's a bit messy, but does what it's supposed to. The engine is opensource and freely available on [github][3]
