Inspired by Yume Nikki and .flow, this is a game I worked on for quite some time. It currently is indefinitely on-hold, until I have completed a couple of projects that are of higher priority to me these days.
Developed with RM2k3.
Some screenshots from the latest development build (so, from 2013 or soâ€¦):
